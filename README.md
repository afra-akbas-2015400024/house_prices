# Prediction of house prices - Kaggle

In this repository, I try to predict the price of houses. I used [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data) for training and testing my project. With different regression techniques, we can estimate the price of a house and use it in several fields.
I used in my project Decision Tree Regressor, and Gradient Boosting Regressor so that we can see the performance of this two regressor.

The procedure I follow:
1. Visualization of data and correlation between features
2. Data cleaning
  2.1 Drop missing data
3. Feature engineering
  3.1 Drop outliers
  3.2 Decreasing skewness
4. Modeling & Evaluation
5. Submission
