# Prediction of house prices - Kaggle

In this repository, I try to predict the price of houses. I used [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data) for training and testing my project. With different regression techniques, we can estimate the price of a house and use it in several fields.
